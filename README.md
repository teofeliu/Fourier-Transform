## Research Overview

Data is ubiquitous in today's world, and the ability to effectively process and manipulate large sets of data is crucial. However, dealing with vast amounts of raw data can be challenging and computationally intensive. This is where the Fourier transform comes into play. By transforming data from the time domain to the frequency domain, the Fourier transform enables us to analyze and manipulate data in a more comprehensible and manageable manner.

The research delves into the fundamentals of Fourier series and transform, examining how they map data from the time domain to the frequency domain. While this might initially seem abstract, the practical implications of Fourier transform are vast. By representing data as a periodic sinusoid function in the frequency domain, Fourier series aids in compressing, processing, and interpreting data. The Fourier transform further extends this concept to an infinite domain, allowing for a wide range of essential procedures across various disciplines.

## Usage

The MATLAB files, **DFT.m** and **FFT.m**, can be utilized to apply the Discrete Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform algorithms to your own data. Simply provide the input data and execute the respective MATLAB script to obtain the transformed output in the frequency domain.

The **Research Presentation.pptx** file provides a condensed overview of the research findings and key insights. It offers an accessible way to grasp the main concepts and results of the study.
